        <h3>Machine Learning Based Heart Disease Pridiction</h3>
        <p>
          According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every year, 10
          million people are affected by heart disease. This highlights the need
          for effective prevention methods. A machine learning-based heart
          disease prediction system has been implemented using various
          algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and
          the Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). Among these, the Random Forest
          Algorithm enhances the accuracy of predictions. It works by taking the
          dataset in a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file or direct input from a
          Graphical User Interface (GUI), converting the data into subsets,
          building decision trees for each subset, and then taking the mean
          prediction. The system then outputs the result, indicating whether the
          person has heart disease or not. The above algorithms are implemented
          using the python programming.

        <h3>Driver Drowsiness Detection using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Accidents are increasing day by day, and it is important to prevent
          these incidents. To reduce the number of accidents, a machine learning
          algorithm, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is
          implemented. This algorithm helps in monitoring and capturing facial
          expressions such as Mouth Opening Ratio (MOR), Eye Opening Ratio
          (EOR), and head position. If drowsiness is detected, the driver
          receives a warning message through a beep sound. The SVM works by
          segregating the images into two classes using a hyperplane, which
          helps alert the driver to wake up. Python programming is used to
          implement SVM and related modules are capture’s the facial expression
          and warning messages.
